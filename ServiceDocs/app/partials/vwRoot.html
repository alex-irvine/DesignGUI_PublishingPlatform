        <p>
            Services are provided with WCF. The database is currently a sandbox MongoDB instance
            which will remain persistent until deployment. There is no service side validation
            beyond natural type safety. Please ensure you validate client side and server side
            before invoking the services.
            <br />
            If a service section is not listed but has been requested please email:<br /> 
            <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-inbox"></span> alex-irvine@hotmail.com
            <hr />
            Please remember to close your service references or use using() directives.
            <br />
            Many thanks
            <br />
