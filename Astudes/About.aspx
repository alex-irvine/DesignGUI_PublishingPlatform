                            <p>Founded in 2015, Astute is focused on the electromagnetics design and services as well as the development 
                                and application to synthesize and optimize designs, in order to analyze the processes and decisions for 
                                improved business performance. Privately held with more than 50 employees, Astute headquartered in Manchester
                                 with collaboration of more than 40 offices throughout 15 countries, and serves many clients across Electromagnetics,
                                 Electronics and different broad industry segments.</p>
                            <p>Our appetite is developing and applying emerging technologies in new and ingenious customs to help our clients
                                 succeed through increased innovation Antenna and Computational Algorithm. we have consistently advanced this
                                 technology to meet evolving customer needs. We innovate constantly in the way we design, the products we create
                                 and the business models we experiment with. Engineering Electromagnetics and simulation are our sole focus.
                                 We aggressively employ our software tools and product development methods, leveraging high-performance computing
                                 and data analytics, so that we can play an enabling role in the great things our clients are accomplishing.
                                 We strongly believe that bringing simulation software and rapid manufacturing technology forward in the design
                                 process can be a source of inspiration along with a winning response to accelerated product lifecycles. </p><br />
                            <p>Our tools used to predict how product designs will behave in real-world environments. We continually advance 
                                simulation solutions by Developing or acquiring the very best Algorithm Methods By helping our customers verify
                                 how their new products will work before ever making a prototype, we save them time and money. Perhaps more 
                                importantly, we give them confidence that their products will perform flawlessly in service an invaluable business
                                 asset. We call this process Efficient Design Automation.</p><br />
                            <p>The Astute suite spans the entire range of physics, so no product design challenge is beyond our capabilities.
                                 Our software tools not only deliver efficiency, it drives innovation. It reduces or eliminates physical 
                                constraints, enabling simulated tests that might otherwise not be possible. It also fosters what-if thinking, 
                                so engineers can readily explore design alternatives for an optimal solution. Because our Tools enables you to 
                                test thousands of designs in the time it used to take to build a single prototype, the possibilities are endless. 
                                But when this exploration is done, Efficient Simulation-Driven design automation method will steer you to best 
                                solution. Also, Integrating them into any simulation complex platform. we help to solve the most complex design 
                                challenges and engineer products limited only by imagination. </p>
